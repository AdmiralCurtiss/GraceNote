<body>

<p>The Font Window can display an entry's text content as it would show up in-game. This can be very helpful to check things, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>In games where the textbox size is limited horizontally or vertically, you can check if the text would overflow outside of the textbox.</li>
<li>In multi-line entries, you can make sure that the text doesn't linebreak in unnatural locations.</li>
<li>Immediately see if your new text uses any symbols not included in the in-game font.</li>
<li>Confirm if you've used name variables, control codes, color tags, etc. correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can right-click within the font window to toggle it being always on top of other windows.</p>

<p>This window needs to be properly configured in the project config file. Refer to <a href="../config/index.html">the project setup page</a> for more information.</p>
