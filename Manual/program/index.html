<h1>General Usage Information</h1>

<p>GraceNote automatically saves changes locally. To save the changes to the server as well, so that other users can see them, you need to select the Save option from the File menu.</p>

<p>Each time you open a project, GraceNote checks the server for file changes from other users and downloads them. This can also be manually triggered at any time using the File -&gt; Update menu option.</p>

<p>Each text entry in is assigned a "status" that indicates how much work has been done on that entry. To more easily work with this, various options on how the entry status is updated are available.</p>
<p>First off, you can set your own Role to one of the status stages. This highlights entries at a lower status in red and entries at the current or higher status in green, and affects what status the program automatically sets modified or viewed entries to according to the current Mode.</p>
<p>There are three Modes: Semi-Auto Mode is the default, which automatically updates the status of all entries you modify to the current Role. If you're at a stage where it's less about modifying every entry and more about making sure the current translation is accurate or sounds good, you might want to switch to Auto Mode, which also updates the status of all entries that have been viewed in the Entry Display in the middle. And for completion's sake, Manual Mode does not automatically update the status at all.</p>
<p>In addition to that, two protection mechanisms exist to prevent erroneous automatic status changes. One, Semi-Auto and Auto will not update the status of an entry that is already on a higher status than the current role. This can be changed in the Preferences. Two, Auto mode supports a threshold, which causes only entries that have already reached a specific status to be updated by it. This can be used to more easily work with databases that only have been partially translated.</p>
