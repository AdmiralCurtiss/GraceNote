<body>

<p>The Changelog displays when a database was changed, and who made the changes.</p>

<p>It comes in two flavors: The Local Changelog displays only information of the currently opened database, while the Global Changelog displays all changes of all databases. In the Global Changelog, you can doubleclick on a database to jump directly to it.</p>
