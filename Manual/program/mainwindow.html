<h2>The Main Window</h2>

<center><img src="mainwindow.png" /></center>

<p>The Main Window is where you'll do most of your translating and editing. It's split into four sections: The Toolbar at the top, the Database List to the left, the Entry List to the right, and the Entry Display in the middle.</p>


<h3>Database List</h3>
<p>To the left, you'll see a categorized list of all databases. In addition to the name of the database, it will also display a number, which indicates the lowest status of all entries contained in it, and a color: Green means that all work is done for that file in the current translation stage, red means there's still stuff to do. It may also display a "c" next to the status number, which means at least one entry has a comment.</p>

<p>Just select any of the databases to load its contents into the Entry List to the right.</p>

<h3>Entry List</h3>
<p>The Entry List shows all entries contained in the currently selected database. By default, it shows all possible information, but columns may be hidden by right-clicking the header.</p>

<p>Selecting any entry fills it and the surrounding entries (one above and several below, depending on how many entries you choose to display in the settings) into the Entry Display in the middle of the screen, ready to be modified.</p>

<p>Each entry corresponds to one string of text in the game. Depending on the game and type of string, this may be as little as a word, or as much as a whole paragraph.</p>

<!-- maybe some stuff about debug here? -->

<h3>Entry Display</h3>
<p>Here you'll actually modify the game text. The Entry Display is right in the middle of the program, and shows a configurable amount of entries, from a minimum of 3 all the way up to 20, if your screen resolution can handle it.</p>

<p>The second entry will always be the one that you've selected in the Entry List, and the one that keyboard shortcuts such as CTRL + digit (change status) affect.</p>

<p>Assuming you haven't turned any of the columns off, the left column will display the current English translation, which you can change, the middle displays the original Japanese, and the right displays a comment on that entry, which is also freely editable.</p>

<p>The circles below the English translation represent the current status of the entry. You can manually change the status of an entry by clicking on those circles. Please refer to the <a href="index.html">general usage guidelines</a> for an explanation of the status.</p>

<p>Text shown between &lt;pointy brackets&gt; is a variable or control code, which gets replaced in-game by something else. They should usually be fairly self-explanatory and are entirely game-specific.</p>

<p>To distinguish between line breaks added because the text automatically wrapped and line breaks that were actually placed (and thus would show up in-game), actual line breaks are ornamented by a carriage return symbol (&#x21b5;). It is not necessary to manually add this when adding a line break, a simple new line with Enter is fine.</p>

<p>If spellchecking via PyEnchant is installed, words that were not recognized will be underlined in red. You can right-click on those to display a list of spelling suggestions.</p>

<p>GraceNote also has a built-in Japanese dictionary. Just highlight and then rightclick any set of Japanese characters to get possible translations for that word or phrase. The dictionary used is an abridged dictionary. It also includes a very succinct kanji lookup.</p>

<h3>Toolbar</h3>
<p>The Toolbar at the top of the window allows quick access to several useful tools and features.</p>

<p>The English, Japanese, and Comments buttons allow you to hide that section of the Entry Display. Press again to show again.</p>

<p>The Reports, Mass Replace, Completion, and Duplicate Text buttons open that specific tool in a separate window. Please refer to their manual pages to find out more about them.</p>

<p>The Jump To box allows you to quickly jump to a specific database if you know its filename but don't want to search for it in the list to the left. Just type in the name and press Enter.</p>
<p>The Search box allows you to quickly find entries containing text you search for. For more involved Search features check out the Mass Replace tool.</p>

<p>The Display Debug button toggles visibility of entries that have been marked as Debug, which are hidden by default. To mark an entry as Debug, check the checkbox in the "Debug?" column of the Entry List. This will hide all entries across all databases that have the same Japanese original text, so be careful with what you mark as debug.</p>

<p>And finally, the Always on Top button makes the program stay on top of other windows.</p>

<h3>Menu</h3>

<p>A lot of menu options are self-explanatory, but here's a few of them that might not be.</p>

<p><b>File -&gt; Save</b>, <b>File -&gt; Update</b> - This saves and retrieves changes to/from the server. Refer to the <a href="index.html">general usage guidelines</a> for more information.</p>
<p><b>File -&gt; Revert</b> - Warning! This throws away all changes made since the last save to the server. Handle with caution.</p>
<p><b>File -&gt; Find Unsaved Databases</b> - This searches all databases for changes that were not yet uploaded to the server. Use in case the program crashes in the middle of a session, or when you've changed the translation of entries via external tools.</p>

<p><b>Edit -&gt; Full Text Copy</b> - This copies the contents of the currently opened database to the clipboard.</p>

<p><b>Role</b> - Use this menu to change the current role, mode, or threshold. Refer to the <a href="index.html">general usage guidelines</a> for more information.</p>

<p><b>Tools -&gt; Propagate Debug</b> - If you've changed the debug status of entries via external tools, you can use these options to sync that status to other entries using the same original Japanese text.</p>
<p><b>Tools -&gt; Refresh Completion Database</b> - This refreshes the cached data on how many entries are at what stage in which database, which is used to display the data in the Completion window as well as color in the databases in the Database List. You shouldn't have to run this ever, but if the data becomes incorrect for whatever reason, you can use this to fix it.</p>
<p><b>Tools -&gt; Find Used Symbols</b> - This saves a file containing a set of all characters used in the entire body of game text to "used_symbols.txt" in the GraceNote directory. Useful if you're creating a font and need to know which glyphs should be available.</p>
