<!--### Introduction ###
On program start up, Grace Note will download any new files from the server that have been modified by others, as long as an internet connection is available.
-->


<h2>The Main Window</h2>

<center><img src="mainwindow.png" /></center>

<p>The Main Window is where you'll do most of your translating and editing. It's split into four sections: The Toolbar at the top, the Database List to the left, the Entry List to the right, and the Entry Display in the middle.</p>


<h3>Database List</h3>
<p>To the left, you'll see a categorized list of all databases. In addition to the name of the database, it will also display a number, which indicates the lowest status of all entries contained in it, and a color: Green means that all work is done for that file in the current translation stage, red means there's still stuff to do. It may also display a "c" next to the status number, which means at least one entry has a comment.</p>

<p>Just select any of the databases to load its contents into the Entry List to the right.</p>

<h3>Entry List</h3>
<p>The Entry List shows all entries contained in the currently selected database. By default, it shows all possible information, but columns may be hidden by right-clicking the header.</p>

<p>Selecting any entry fills it and the surrounding entries (one above and several below, depending on how many entries you choose to display in the settings) into the Entry Display in the middle of the screen, ready to be modified.</p>

<p>Each entry corresponds to one string of text in the game. Depending on the game and type of string, this may be as little as a word, or as much as a whole paragraph.</p>

<!-- maybe some stuff about debug here? -->

<h3>Entry Display</h3>
<p></p>

<!-- The three editing windows show the above, currently selected, and below entries, respectively. When an entry is selected, these boxes will contain the entry text, which can be edited. Variables are shown between angle brackets (<>), and newlines have been ornamented with a carriage return symbol. The brackets ARE required for all variables, but the carriage return symbol is optional, and need not be typed. Variables will also appear in colour. Editing windows support copy, paste, cut, select all, undo, and redo, via keyboard shortcuts and the right click menu ONLY. The edit menu is non-functional at this time, excepting full-text copy.

In the lower right corner are four symbols. These symbols denote the completion status of the entry. Green signifies the stage is complete, and blue signifies incomplete. These will be automatically modified dependent on the role you have set. You may also change them manually by clicking on them. The four stages are Translation, Translation Review, Context Review, and Editing, from left to right.

If Pyenchant is installed, red lines beneath typed words will denote misspelled words. You may correct these yourself, or right-click them to pop up a list of suggestions.

At any time, you may select a Japanese word and right click it. The contextual menu will contain a list of suggested words, as well as their English equivalents and definitions. The dictionary used is an abridged dictionary, for conciseness. The dictionary also includes a very succinct kanji lookup. -->

<h3>Toolbar</h3>
<p>The Toolbar at the top of the window allows quick access to several useful tools and features.</p>

<p>The English, Japanese, and Comments buttons allow you to hide that section of the Entry Display. Press again to show again.</p>

<p>The Reports, Mass Replace, Completion, and Duplicate Text buttons open that specific tool in a separate window. Please refer to their manual pages to find out more about them.</p>

<p>The Jump To box allows you to quickly jump to a specific database if you know its filename but don't want to search for it in the list to the left. Just type in the name and press Enter.</p>
<p>The Search box allows you to quickly find entries containing text you search for. For more involved Search features check out the Mass Replace tool.</p>

This is all super outdated, doesn't even make sense to nicely format it.












#### Debug Toggle ####
Debug toggle changes the viewing of debug entries on or off. This is off by default.


### The Menu Bar ###
The menu bar contains all functions present in the toolbar, as well as several others.


#### File Menu ####

##### Save #####
Saves all changes done this session to the server. This may take some time, but there should be a progress bar.


#### Edit Menu ####
Most functions in the Edit Menu, for reasons beyond mortal comprehension, do not work. You may access these functions through their standard keyboard shortcuts, but selecting the menu item does not work.


##### Full-Text Copy #####
Full Text Copy only functions when a file or entry is selected. It will paste the entire contents of the file to the clipboard.


#### View Menu ####




#### Role Menu ####
The Role which is currently set determines to which completion meter you add. The role is displayed in the title of the Main Window. Setting the role correctly is important to ensuring proper progress bars.

#### Mode Menu ####
The Mode is used in conjunction with Roles in order to determine which files can be labelled complete.

##### Semi-Auto #####
In semi-auto mode, any entries you edit will be marked as ‘complete’ for your current role, and the completion percentage updated accordingly. You can manually set an entry to complete by using the icons in the lower right a text box when an entry is selected. This is the default mode.

##### Auto #####
In automatic mode, any entries which are viewed on screen will be set to ‘complete’ for your current role, and the completion percentage updated accordingly. You can manually set an entry to complete by using the icons in the lower right a text box when an entry is selected. This is useful for editing where entries may need to be read, but not necessarily edited, and manual clicking becomes tedious. This mode will not currently be kept between sessions, and must reset each time.

##### Manual #####
No changes to the status of entries will happen in this mode unless the status icons in each entry are manually clicked.
