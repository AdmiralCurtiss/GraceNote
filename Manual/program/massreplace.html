#### Mass Replace ####
Mass Replace is a powerful tool for searching and replacing text across files. You can search for text as part of an entry (exact match), or an entire entry on it’s own (entry match). Upon searching, a list will be generated that details the entry’s current English, if available, or Japanese if not, the file that contains it, and the entry number it occupies. You may selectively replace searches by modifying the check boxes provided. No text will be replaced until you click replace in the bottom left. This action can not be undone!

Some notes about Mass Replace. Is it possible and recommended to use the search feature on it’s own for a more precise search. You may not Mass replace whitespace or non-visible characters. Replace will not take effect without a search being done prior to the replacement. Deleting the text in search before replacing will modify the text to be replaced, so, it is possible to search for entries with ‘foo’ and then replace all instances of ‘bar’ within that set with some other text of choice (such as ‘I pity the’).
