<head><title>GraceNote - Duplicate Text</title></head>
<body>

<p>The Duplicate Text tool allows you to quickly find all entries that are the same in Japanese, but not the same in the translation (yet). This can be very useful for applying a translation of common text over the whole game, such as in cases where the same system or event text is duplicated across multiple game files. You can also use it to make sure you haven't accidentally translated some things inconsistently that should stay the same.</p>

<p>The tool can filter according to database categories, for example when you only want to duplicate check within the system text but not in dialogue. Check the database categories that should be checked, then hit Search.</p>

<p>By default, only inconsistent translations are displayed. This includes entries that are translated the same but are not on the sametranslation status. You can change this to displaying all duplicates using the radio buttons at the top.</p>

<p>After searching, all duplicates are displayed in a list, nesting all existing translations under the original Japanese entry. To match an inconsistent translation, simply double-click the desired translation. This will automatically open up and fill the Mass Replace tool in a way where all you need to do is hit Replace to match the translation.</p>
