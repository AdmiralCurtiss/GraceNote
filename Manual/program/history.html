<body>

<p>The History window displays past versions of the currently selected entry.</p>

<p>The window is split into three sections: The top displays a list of all changes, the columns listing when the entry was changed by which user, what status it was at that point, and what parts of the entry (<u>E</u>nglish, <u>S</u>tatus, <u>C</u>omment) were changed. Click on any of them to display how the entry looked after that change in the two sections below: The English text in the middle, and the Comment at the bottom.</p>

<p>By default it always displays the version right before the current one.</p>
