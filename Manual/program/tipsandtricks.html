<h3>Quickly scrolling through entries via keyboard</h3>
<p>Use the Ctrl or Alt key in combination with the up or down arrow to scroll the selected entry up or down. This works while the cursor is in any of the Entry Display panels.</p>

<h3>Hyperlinking entries via comments</h3>
<p>It is possible to reference other databases and/or entries within comments in a way GraceNote recognizes. By placing a database name, entry ID, or both in [square brackets], you can then rightclick on that text to get the option to directly jump there.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>[123]</u> links to Entry 123 within the current database.</li>
<li><u>[MenuText]</u> links to the top of the MenuText database.</li>
<li><u>[MenuText/123]</u> links to Entry 123 within the MenuText database.</li>
</ul>
